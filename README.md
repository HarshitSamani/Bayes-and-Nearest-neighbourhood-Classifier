<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Repository

This repository holds the python implementation files for Assignment #1 for E1 213 Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks offered at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. In this assignment we will explore and compare different methods of classifiers. In all the problems, we have some data on which  2-class classifiers have to be learnt, and then its performance has to be assessed using a test set. The following methods have been implemented across the problems.

* Bayes classifier
* Nearest neighbour classifier
* EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures
* Density estimation
* Maximum Likelihood Estimation 
* Sentiment analysis (Movie review)

Problem 1 deals with the implementation of 2-class Bayes classifier, and nearest neighbour classifier using the values estimated by maximum likelihood and EM algorithm for GMM. 
Problem 2 deals with the implementation of 2-class Bayes classifier using the values estimated by maximum likelihood and nearest neighbour classifier.  
Problem 3 deals with implementation of Bayes classifier for Gaussian mixture class conditional densities. 
Problem 4 deals with the implementation of sentiment analysis of movie reviews using bag of words approach and TF-IDF approach.
